Simple chemiscope input
=======================

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the chemiscope package, reading structures
and properties from an ASE package and preparing a chemiscope file to visualize them.
Use `chemiscope.show` in a Jupyter notebook for interactive visualization

Load structures from an extended xyz file

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-24

.. code-block:: Python


    frames = ase.io.read("data/showcase.xyz", ":")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-28

A chemiscope widget can be used to visualize structures and properties.
This generates a Chemiscope object that is rendered to an interactive
widget when executed in a Jupyter notebook.

    chemiscope.show(
        frames=frames,

        # sharing, don't forget to also include metadata such as units and description

        meta=dict(name="Dipole and polarizability"),
        # it is possible to set _all_ visualization parameters with a dictionary format.

For sharing with collaborators, or when one does not want to use an interactive
notebook, one can also write a JSON (or compressed JSON) file that contains all
information about structures and properties, and can be viewed at chemiscope.org
Save as a file that can be viewed at chemiscope.org

In a notebook it is also possible to load a `.json` file and create an interactive
widget from it.
